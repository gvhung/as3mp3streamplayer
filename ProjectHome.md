This project requires Flash player 10 and allows you to play shoutcast mp3 streams without memory problems.

Check the Wiki of the project for more information.

NOTE: I am working on other projects and do not have a project using this code. This project for me is in the background, so from me, no active development is done. If you wish to add features or found a bug, please contact me at gmail so I can make you a project member.
